# Single source of truth for the guard roster, shared by the "Verify workflow
# and script guards" step in .github/workflows/ci.yml and section 4 of
# scripts/ci_checks.sh. The checkers are named explicitly because a few of them
# belong to other jobs (check_bun_audit.py needs Bun, check_codegen.py runs via
# codegen.sh), but their regression tests are discovered by glob so a newly
# added scripts/test_*.py is picked up automatically instead of having to be
# remembered in two places.
